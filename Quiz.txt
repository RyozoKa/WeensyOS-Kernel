Question 1:
1KB = 10bits, answer: 10 bits

Question 2:
16bit = 64kb, 64kb / 1kb = 64, 64 = 6 bits, answer: 6bits

Question 3:
64kb / 1kb = 64, answer: 64 pages

Question 4:
A,
B,
C,
E,
F
Question 5:
4kb / 1kb = 4, answer: 4 frames(pages)

Question 6:
A flat page table uses only a single table, where only the VPN (Virtual page number) is stored. For 16 bits, 6 bits would be needed to represent a VPN.
We have 64 pages in 16 bit VA. We have 12 bits of additional data for each entry. Size = (6 + 12) * 64, answer: 1152 bits

Question 7:
Are they asking for CR3? 

Question 8:
